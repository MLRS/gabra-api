# Database schema

This page describes the general schema of the Ä abra database.
Since the database is based on JSON, this is not a schema in the traditional sense; it is rather a set of guidelines for what fields can be contained in each collection.

- Internal `_id` fields are not included here.
- Items separated by commas ( **,** ) indicate example values.
- Items separated by slashes ( **/** ) indicate a set of allowed values.
- This document lists all _possible_ fields; most are optional and many entries will only a have subset of them.
- We treat a null field the same as a missing field.

## Collection `lexemes`

{{lexeme.json}}

## Collection `wordforms`

{{wordform.json}}

## Collection `roots`

{{root.json}}

## Collection `sources`

{{source.json}}

## Collection `logs`

{{log.json}}

**Note:** Because of a previous bug, the `collection` field may erroneously show 'lexemes' instead of 'wordforms', in particular for deletions.
